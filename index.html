				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>(+ 2 fully earnest)</strong>This decision makes my visualization persuasive because the reader can see clearly 
					that California and New York having a drastic decrease in the number of abortion clinics 
					from 2017 to 2020. Even though California and New York are two of the states with the least 
					amount of restrictive abortion laws, they had the most significant decrease in the number of 
					abortion clinics <a target="_blank" href="https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/kentucky/abortion-policies">(https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/kentucky/abortion-policies)</a>. The side by side of the number of abortion clinics in 2017 and the number of abortion clinics in 2020 works well, since it allows the reader to quickly compare the two values. Alternatively, I tried to put the number of abortion clinics from 2017 and 2020 on two different bar graphs. This did not work well because the y-axis was not normalized so it made it harder to compare the two years, and the difference was not as distinguishable. I settled on this design because it allowed the readers to make 
					a comparison between the number of clinics from 2017 and 2020</li>
				
					<li><strong>(+1 earnest)</strong>This decision helps make my visualization persuasive, because it efficiently conveys the trends 
					that the number of abortion clinics in each state in the U.S. has decreased. The reader does not have to look 
					through as much data that would excessively reiterate the trend. Additionally, the reader can see that California, 
					New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut have the greatest percentage decrease in the number of abortion clinics in 
					2017 to 2020. Reducing the number of states that were present in the visualization worked well, because the 
					visualization was hard to view with all 50 states present. This made the trend less obvious to notice. 
					Unfortunately, this visualization does exclude some of the states that had a greater percentage decrease in the 
					number of abortion clinics from 2017 to 2020. It would have been good to show some of the other states like Hawaii 
					that had 83% or decrease in the number of abortions clinics from 2017 to 2020. Alternatively, I considered to 
					incorporate states that might had less than 20 abortion clinics but a big percentage decrease in the number of 
					abortion clinics from 2017 to 2020. I decided to make another visualization that showcases the percentage 
					decrease in the number of abortion clinics from 2017 to 2020. I settled on this design, because it was 
					concise and it efficiently conveyed the trend from all 50 states with only using 20% of the states. 
					Additionally, it emphasizes my proposition that all states, even ones that did not enact TRAP laws from 2010 to 2017, 
					were affected and the access to safe abortions decreased nationally.
				</li>
				
				<li><strong>(-1 deceptive)</strong> This decision helps make my visualization persuasive, because it showcases 
					the negative correlation between the percentage of counties without a number of clinics and the number of 
					abortions for women ages 15 - 44. This demonstrates that the number of abortions is negatively effected by 
					the lack of abortion clinics in counties. This is slightly deceptive since it is intuitive that women would 
					have a harder time to getting access to abortions if they do not have access to an abortion clinic. However, 
					this visualization emphasizes my proposition that the TRAP laws enacted in southern states, affect liberal 
					states (decreased in no. of abortion clinics). Having each state be a different color worked well to help 
					distinguish the data points. Additionally, I excluded Connecticut and the District of Columbia because they 
					both had zero values. However, some of the data points are overlapinging each other so it is challenging to 
					differentiate the states that are clustered towards the bottom right of the scatter plot. Alternatively, I 
					considered removing some of the data points to see if reducing the size of the cluster would help the 
					persuasiveness of the visualization. However, I settled on this design since I determined that keeping 
					the cluster of data points reinforced my proposition. This version of the visualization reinforced my 
					proposition by showcasing that a significant portion of the states have a negative correlation between 
					the number of abortions and the number of counties without an abortion clinics.
				</li>
				<li><strong>(+1 earnest)</strong>This decision helps make my visualization persuasive, because it shows how the 
					number of abortion clinics has overall decreased in each state in the U.S. Removing Montana, Wyoming, 
					North Dakota, and Kansas from the visualization worked well since they were outliers. Montana had an small 
					increase in the number of abortions from 2017 to 2020 and this would detract from the point that I tried to 
					convey with the rest of the graph. Additionally, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Kansas had the same number of 
					abortion clinics from 2017 to 2020, so similarly it worked well to remove these states to avoid empty space 
					on the graph. Making the percentage negative did not work as well as I had presumed. The negative percentage 
					forces the reader to take more time analyzing the graph and might lead to potential confusion on how to 
					interpret the visualization. Alternatively, I considered making the percentages positive to make the graph 
					more traditional. I settled on the design decisions to keep the percentages negative. It illustrates how 
					the number of abortion is decreasing from the falling down effect of the visualization.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>(- 2 fully earnest)</strong> This decision helps make my visualization persuasive because the 
					readers only see the positive percentage of abortion rate. This indicates that there has been an increase 
					in the number of abortions from 2017 to 2020 which opposes by proposition. Additionally, the readers do 
					not initially know that there are states that have a decrease in the percentage of change in the abortion 
					rate. So at first glance a reader can assume that the number of abortions in the U.S. have only increased, 
					which persuades the reader to oppose my proposition. Having no states with a negative percentage for the 
					change in abortion rate went well. It reduced the number of states the reader has to look at and helps in 
					deceiving the reader. Additionally, the reader can see that the states with a greater positive percentage 
					change in the abortion rate were southern states-Oklahoma, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Idaho, which does 
					oppose my proposition that the TRAP laws decreased access to abortions. Alternatively, I considered 
					removing Oklahoma since it is an outlier amongst the states with a positive percentage of the change 
					of the abortion rate. However, I settled on this design choice to keep all the positive percentage 
					change of the number of abortions. It effectively deceives the reader into interpreting that the U.S. 
					has had an increase in the number of abortions after the TRAP laws.
				</li>
				<li><strong>(-1 deceptive)</strong> This decision helps make my visualization persuasive, because it makes 
					the data more visceral. The reader gets a reminder of the implications behind a higher abortion rate. 
					Using the dead cartoon baby marker worked well since this is more rememberable the standard circle 
					shape used for scatter plot. This makes it more likely that the reader remembers the visualization. 
					Additionally, the bow tie on the cartoon baby adds a layer of innocence, which appeals to the readers 
					pathos. The dead cartoon baby draws the reader’s attention away from the fact that not all the states 
					are depicted in the visualization, which is a deceptive tactic. Alternatively, I considered using 
					women shape instead of the dead cartoon baby to represent the distinct data points. Ultimately, 
					I settled on using the dead cartoon baby shape, because it is more effective in drawing the reader’s attention.
				</li>
				<li><strong>(- 2 fully earnest)</strong>This decision helps make my visualization persuasive, because 
					it makes it seem like a vast majority of states in the U.S. have had an increase in the percentage 
					change of the number of abortion clinics from 2017 to 2020. Making fourteen of the states with a 
					zero percent change in the number of abortion clinics a light blue color worked well. This erroneously 
					emphasizes that more states have had an increase in the number of abortion clinics by the shading 
					of the graph. Additionally, having some states completely grey worked well. At first glance, it 
					potentially deceives the readers into thinking that the states that are completely grey are states 
					with no change in the number of abortion clinics. Alternatively, I considered not filtering out 
					the negative percentage change for the abortion clinics. However, I settled on my design decision 
					of only coloring states with a percentage of 0 or more. That way readers would be less likely to 
					perceive the deception tactics of including zero values. 
				</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		As I went through the design process for both visualization I tried to remove any bias I had while I was analyzing the data. Additionally, having to score how deceptive or 
		earnest my design decisions were helped me realize that as I performed my data analysis I was still biased. When I scored visualizations that supported my proposition I tended 
		to score more positively, compared to the visualizations that opposed my proposition. Overall, designing visualizations to persuade readers that my proposition is true was more 
		difficult than designing visualizations to persuade readers that my proposition is false. It was difficult to not manipulate data too much to aid my efforts to persuade readers that my proposition is true. Moreover, it was difficult to come up with a proposition when I had to simultaneously think about how I would disprove my proposition. I was surprised at how easy it is to use the same dataset and come up with a different conclusion. It enlightened me on how easy it is to manipulate data to benefit your preconceived viewpoint on a manner. Creating both visualizations demonstrated that the person analyzing the data has a lot of power, and can choose to use it ethically or not.
	I now define “ethical analysis and visualization” as the practice of not drastically altering the dataset to benefit your implicit or explicit bias. Making sure to responsibly use your skills to accurately represent any relationships in the dataset. It is hard to draw bounds to distinguish “acceptable” persuasive choices vs. “misleading” ones, since I sometimes made similar design choices for both visualizations. For instance I decided to truncate the y-axis for scatter plot for my opposition visualization to deceive the readers, however, I had to truncate the y-axis for the upside down bar graph to avoid detracting from my point. Therefore, I draw the bounds of “acceptable” persuasive choices by allowing the removal of outliers that can skew the data. However, removing half the data that would indicate a different trend would be categorized as a “misleading” choices. Ultimately, to distinguish between the different design choices a person needs to recognize whether their analysis or trend of their data fundamentally changes from their design choice. If the design choice enhances then I would consider that an “acceptable” persuasive choice. However, if the design choice changes the interpretation of the dataset then I would consider that a “misleading” persuasive choice. It is open to the discretion of the data analyst to be able to distinguish between a design choice that changes the trend of the dataset or enhances the trend present in the dataset.
